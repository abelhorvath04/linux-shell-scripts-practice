# Shell Scripting

## Purpose

This project was created to practice shell scripting concepts and prepare for the LPI Linux Essentials exam. The scripts focus on solving real-world problems often encountered in Linux system administration and shell scripting tasks.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. **digitsum.sh**
Calculates the sum of digits for each valid number input. If any input is invalid, it throws an error.

### 2. **minmaxsum.sh**
Calculates the minimum, maximum, and sum of a list of valid numbers provided as arguments.

### 3. **monotonic.sh**
Determines whether the input numbers are monotonically increasing, decreasing, constant, or non-monotonic.

### 4. **numbertype.sh**
Checks if the argument is positive, negative, zero, or "not-a-number."

### 5. **primality.sh**
Determines whether each input number is prime or not.

### 6. **series.sh**
Generates an arithmetic sequence and prints each number along with its square and cube.

### 7. **findip.sh**
Extracts and counts the frequency of each IPv4 address from a file.

### 8. **freeid.sh**
Determines the next available UID in the system's password file. You can specify the minimum UID and the password file as arguments.

### 9. **linenumbers.sh**
Simulates the functionality of the `nl` command, printing line numbers along with the input text.

### 10. **topsourceip.sh**
Counts and displays the frequency of each source IP address from a log file.

### 11. **trafficperprotocol.sh**
Processes a log file and calculates the sum of packet sizes per protocol (TCP and UDP).

### 12. **userusage.sh**
Displays the disk space usage of files owned by a specific user within a given directory.

### 13. **fileformat.sh**
Determines the file format based on the file extension and provides an appropriate label.

### 14. **renamefiles.sh**
- Renames files by converting their extensions to lowercase and truncating file names if they exceed 12 characters.
- URL-encodes input arguments and formats them for use in URLs.
- Formats input names by capitalizing the first letter and converting the rest to lowercase.
- Checks the file extension and returns the corresponding file type (Text, Image, JavaScript, etc.).
